## Creating a New Project

When creating a new project in the Tribble browser extension, you have two options:

1. **Uploading an Entire Questionnaire**: Ideal for complete questionnaires in supported formats (DOCX, PDF, or XLSX). Best for standardized forms or well-structured documents.
2. **Manual Question Entry**: Perfect for online portals, unsupported formats, or complex spreadsheets. Allows manual input or copy-paste from various sources.

## Option 1: Uploading an Entire Questionnaire

1. **Start New Project**  
   * Click "Create Project" button  
   * Select "Upload Questionnaire"

2. **Upload File**  
   * Supported file types: DOCX, PDF, XLSX  

3. **Enter Project Details**  
   * Project title  
   * Customer name  
   * Salesforce opportunity (if connected to Salesforce)  
   * Due date  
   * Project owner  

4. **Select Tags (Optional)**  
   * Select relevant tags (product, region, etc.)  
   * Tags help confine Tribble's responses to relevant content

5. **Configure Verbosity Settings**  
   * Set answer length:  
      * Default: ~100 words  
      * Shorter: ~50 words  
      * Longer: ~150 words  
   * Enable "Terse yes or no answers" option for simple responses

6. **Confirm and Process**  
   * Review details and click "Create Project"

7. **Tribble Analysis**  
   After clicking "Create Project", Tribble begins analysis:

   ### For spreadsheet-style questionnaires:
   1. Extracts all questions
   2. Generates responses

   ### For long-form proposal responses:
   1. Analyzes the document
   2. Evaluates against "Go/No-Go" criteria (if set up)
      * Provides feedback based on criteria
      * Allows proceeding if RFx matches business needs
   3. Generates proposal response

## Option 2: Manual Question Input

Ideal for:
* Portal-based questionnaires
* Unsupported file formats
* Complex file formats
* Function-based grouping (Legal, Security, Product, etc.)

Process:
1. Follow steps from Option 1, skipping file upload
2. Use "Add Questions" button to manually input or copy-paste questions

<Note>
Teams can filter by "groupings" to focus on their specific responsibilities.
</Note>

## Notifications

Tribble sends notifications through your preferred channel (Slack, Teams, or Email) when:
* Questionnaire completion is finished
* Proposal response is generated
* Other significant project updates occur
