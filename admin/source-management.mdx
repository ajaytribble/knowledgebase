The Sources section in the Tribble Admin Console allows you to manage the content that Tribble uses to generate responses. This article provides an overview of source management in Tribble.

## Access

1. Log into the Tribble Console
2. Navigate to "Sources"

## Types of Sources

Tribble can ingest and utilise various types of sources:

### Documents
- CSV
- XLSX
- PDF
- DOCX
- PPTX

### Websites
- URLs of web pages containing relevant information

### Integrations
- Slack
- Confluence
- Notion
- Google Drive
- Zendesk
- High Spot
- Seismic
- Guru
- Salesforce
- SharePoint

## Key Features of Source Management

### Source List
- View all ingested source content in one place
- Sort by status, content type, ingest date, and upload user
- Filter by integration, upload date, and search keyword(s)

### Source Content
- Click into a source to view content
- See extracted facts and their usage statistics
- Filter facts by tag, owner, or search keyword(s)

### Tagging
Apply tags to source facts to segment Tribble's brain

<Note>
**Example**: "NA" tags were applied to this security questionnaire. When we receive a security questionnaire from a North American customer, or have a specific question tied to the NA region, we can tell Tribble in the browser extension to use sources tagged with "NA" or include that specification in natural language when chatting with Tribble in Slack.
