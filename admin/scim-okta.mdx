description: 'Configure SCIM user provisioning with Okta'
---

This guide walks you through setting up SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) with Okta for automated user provisioning in Tribble.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Admin access to your Okta account
- Admin access to Tribble
- Your Tribble SCIM endpoint URL
- Your Tribble SCIM API token

## Setup Steps

### In Tribble
1. Navigate to Settings > Integrations
2. Select "SCIM Configuration"
3. Generate a SCIM API token
4. Copy the SCIM endpoint URL

### In Okta

1. Log in to your Okta admin console
2. Navigate to Applications > Applications
3. Click "Add Application"
4. Search for "Tribble" or select "Create SAML Integration"
5. Configure the application settings:
   - Application name: "Tribble"
   - SCIM connector base URL: Your Tribble SCIM endpoint
   - Unique identifier field for users: "email"
   - Supported provisioning actions: 
     - Import New Users and Profile Updates
     - Push New Users
     - Push Profile Updates
     - Push User Deactivation

## Configuration

### Attribute Mapping
Configure the following attribute mappings in Okta:

| Okta Attribute | Tribble Attribute |
|---------------|------------------|
| userName      | email           |
| firstName     | firstName       |
| lastName      | lastName        |
| email         | email           |

### Testing

1. Assign the Tribble application to a test user in Okta
2. Verify the user is created in Tribble
3. Update the user's profile in Okta
4. Verify changes are reflected in Tribble
5. Deactivate the test user in Okta
6. Verify access is revoked in Tribble

<Note>
Changes in Okta may take a few minutes to reflect in Tribble.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### User Not Provisioned
- Verify SCIM endpoint URL
- Check API token validity
- Confirm attribute mappings

#### Sync Delays
- Allow up to 15 minutes for changes to propagate
- Check Okta system logs for errors

#### Authentication Errors
- Regenerate and update SCIM API token
- Verify endpoint URL format

## Best Practices

- Regularly monitor SCIM logs
- Test with a small user group first
- Document your configuration
- Keep API tokens secure
- Set up alerts for sync failures
