## Overview

This article guides you through the process of setting up the Highspot integration in Tribble and explains how to use it effectively.

## Setting Up Highspot Integration

1. Navigate to the Integrations tab under Sources
2. Click on "Add More Integration" (ðŸ“„ Accessing Integrations)
3. Select Highspot from the list of available integrations
4. Input your Highspot API credentials:  
   * Highspot API Key  
   * Highspot API Secret
5. Click "Connect" to establish the integration

## Viewing and Selecting Highspot Content

Once connected, you'll be able to view all the Spots within your Highspot account. You have two options for ingesting content:

1. **One-time File Ingestion**: Select and ingest a specific file from a Spot.
2. **Spot Watching**: Continuously ingest and monitor a Spot for changes.

### One-time File Ingestion

* Select a specific file within a Spot to ingest into Tribble
* The file content will be added to Tribble's knowledge base
* Any subsequent changes to the file in Highspot will not be reflected in Tribble

### Watching a Spot

* Choose to "watch" an entire Spot
* Tribble will continuously monitor the Spot for changes
* New files added to the Spot will be automatically ingested
* Updates to existing files will be captured
* Deleted files will be removed from Tribble's knowledge base

## Important Considerations

1. **File Permissions**: Some files in Highspot may have restricted permissions. Tribble can only ingest files that the integration user has permission to access.
2. **Unsupported File Types**: Certain file types, such as MP3 and MP4, are not supported by Tribble and cannot be ingested.
3. **Content Updates**: When watching a Spot, be aware that any changes in Highspot will be reflected in Tribble. This ensures your knowledge base stays up-to-date.

## Best Practices

* Regularly review the Spots being watched to ensure they still contain relevant information
* Use descriptive names for ingested files and watched Spots in Tribble for easy management
