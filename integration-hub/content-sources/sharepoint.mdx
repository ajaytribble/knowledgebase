This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using Tribble's SharePoint integration. 

## Step 1: Access the SharePoint Integration 

Log in to your Tribble account. Navigate to the "Sources" section in the left sidebar. Click the "+ Add Source" button in the top right corner. In the "Manage Integrations" modal, select the SharePoint icon. 

## Step 2: Authorize the Integration 

After selecting SharePoint, you'll be prompted to authorize the integration with your Microsoft account. A Microsoft permissions window will appear. Review the permissions requested by the Tribble SharePoint Integration. If you agree, click the "Accept" button to grant access. 

## Step 3: Select SharePoint Sites

Once authorized, you'll see a list of available SharePoint sites associated with your account. Browse the list of SharePoint sites. Select the sites you want to integrate with Tribble by clicking on them. Each selected site will display a chain link icon, indicating it's connected.

## Step 4: Navigate and Watch Folders 

After selecting your desired sites, you can navigate through the folder structure and choose specific folders to watch. Click on a site to expand its folder structure. Navigate to the folder you want to watch. Click the "Watch" button in the top right corner to monitor the selected folder.

When you click "Watch," a confirmation dialog will appear: Click "Submit" to confirm and start watching the folder. 

## Step 5: Managing Your Integration 

After setting up the integration, you can manage your connected SharePoint sources from the main Sources page. Return to the "Sources" section in Tribble. You'll see your connected SharePoint folders listed among your other sources. You can filter, search, and manage these sources as needed.

## Troubleshooting 

If you encounter any issues during the setup process:
* Ensure you have the necessary permissions in both Tribble and SharePoint
* Try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration
* Clear your browser cache and cookies, then attempt the process again
* If problems persist, contact Tribble support for assistance
