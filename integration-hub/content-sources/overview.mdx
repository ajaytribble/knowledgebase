This article guides Tribble administrators through the process of accessing Tribble integrations, with best practices for integration user management.

## Accessing Integrations

1. Log into the Tribble Admin Console
2. Navigate to the "Sources" page
3. Click on the "Integrations" tab

## Best Practices for Integration Users

When setting up integrations, it's important to create dedicated integration user accounts rather than using existing employee accounts. Here's why:

### Creating Dedicated Integration Users

1. **Stability**: Dedicated integration users ensure that integrations continue to function even if individual employees leave the company.
2. **Security**: Separate integration accounts allow for more granular control over permissions and access.
3. **Traceability**: It's easier to track and manage integration activities when they're associated with dedicated accounts.
4. **Maintenance**: Updating or troubleshooting integrations is simpler when using dedicated accounts.

### Naming Convention for Integration Users

We recommend using a consistent naming convention for integration users. For example:

* Tribble_confluence@company.com
* Tribble_salesforce@company.com
* Tribble_highspot@company.com

This naming convention clearly identifies the purpose of the account and its association with Tribble.

## Important Notes

* Always use a company email domain for integration users, not personal email addresses
* Ensure that integration users have the necessary permissions in both Tribble and the integrated platform
* Regularly review and update integration user permissions as needed

## Next Steps

1. Choose your first integration from the checklist above
2. Navigate to the specific integration guide in the sidebar
3. Follow the step-by-step setup instructions
4. Return to this checklist to set up additional integrations
