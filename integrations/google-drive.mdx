This article guides you through setting up and using the Google Drive integration in Tribble.

## Initial Setup

1. Navigate to the Sources section in Tribble Admin Console
2. Click on the "Integrations" tab
3. Click "Add More Integrations"
4. Select "Google Drive"

## Authentication Process

1. **Sign In with Google**  
   * Click the "Sign in with Google" button  
   * Select the appropriate Google account  
   * Click "Continue"  

2. **Permission Consent**  
   1. **Important Note About Permissions:** While Google Drive requests permission to "see and download all your Google Drive files," Tribble will ONLY access and ingest files that you explicitly select later. This permission:  
         * Does NOT mean Tribble automatically ingests all files  
         * Only allows Tribble to see file names until you specifically choose files to ingest  
         * Gives you complete control over which files are added to Tribble  

3. **Accept Permissions**  
   * Review the permissions  
   * Click "Allow" to complete the connection

## Selecting Content to Sync

After connecting, open the Google Drive integration from the Integrations tab in Sources. You can sync content at three levels:

1. **Entire Drives**
2. **Folders**  
   * Select specific folders to sync  
   * All contents within selected folders will be synced
3. **Individual Files**  
   * Choose specific files to sync  
   * Most precise control over synced content

## File Configuration

For certain file types (i.e. CSV, XLSX), additional setup is required during ingestion. You have two ways to configure these files:

### Option 1: Configure During Ingestion

* When selecting files in Sources â†’ Integrations â†’ Google Drive
* Configure files immediately as part of the ingestion process
* Follow the file-specific setup instructions as outlined inðŸ“„ Uploading Files to Tribble

### Option 2: Configure from Review Section

1. You'll receive a notification for files that need configuration
2. Navigate to Brain â†’ Review in the left sidebar
3. Find files awaiting configuration
4. Click to configure directly from this screen

## Viewing Synced Files

To view your ingested Google Drive files:

1. Go to the Sources section
2. Navigate to the Documents tab
3. Look for files with the Google Drive icon
4. Use the filter bar to specifically view Google Drive files

## Best Practices

1. Start with syncing individual files or specific folders before syncing entire Drives
2. Regularly review synced content to ensure relevance
3. Use the filter option in Sources to easily manage Google Drive content
4. Configure spreadsheet files carefully during ingestion for optimal results
